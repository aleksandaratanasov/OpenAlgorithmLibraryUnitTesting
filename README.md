# OpenAlgorithmLibraryUnitTesting
Unit testing using the Google Test framework for the OpenAlgorithmLibrary

Note: Back then when I wrote this I didn't know that test_f (test fixture) is part of GTest. Probably in the near future I will rewrite the test units. Using test_f can cover all those cases but with much less lines of code
